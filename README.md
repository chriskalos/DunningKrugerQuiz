# Dunning-Kruger Quiz Application (dkq.py)

This repository contains a Python-based quiz application that demonstrates the Dunning-Kruger effect. The application allows users to take a quiz on various topics, assess their confidence, and then shows them where they stand on the Dunning-Kruger curve.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you'll need Python installed on your system. The application is built and tested with Python 3.x. If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash git clone https://github.com/chriskalos/DunningKrugerQuiz.git```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

After cloning, navigate into the project directory:

```cd DunningKrugerQuiz```

3. **Install Required Packages**

Before running the application, you need to install the required Python packages. The requirements.txt file lists all the necessary packages. Install them using the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Note: On systems where both Python 2.x and Python 3.x are installed, you may need to run `pip3` instead of `pip`:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
